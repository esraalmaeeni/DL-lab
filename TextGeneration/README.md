# LSTM RNN Training

## Overview
This script is designed to train an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence modeling using a given dataset. It includes data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, sequence conversion to tensors, and model training.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
```

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and processed to create sequences for training. Ensure the dataset file is available before execution.

## One-Hot Encoding
The sequences are converted into one-hot encoded tensors for efficient processing by the LSTM model.

## Model Definition
An LSTM model is defined with embedding layers, hidden states, and an output layer for sequence prediction.

## Training the Model
The model is trained using a loss function and an optimizer, ensuring it learns to predict the next elements in the sequence effectively.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Train the model using the provided functions.
4. Evaluate and test the trained model on unseen data.

## Expected Outputs
The model will output a trained LSTM capable of making sequence predictions based on input data.

## Conclusion
This script provides a structured approach to training an LSTM-based RNN for sequence modeling. By leveraging PyTorch, it efficiently preprocesses data, applies one-hot encoding, and trains a deep learning model to predict sequential patterns. The trained model can be used for various sequence-based tasks, such as text prediction, time-series forecasting, or other NLP applications. Future improvements may include hyperparameter tuning, adding dropout for regularization, or experimenting with different model architectures for better performance.
